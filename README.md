While the code itself is heavily commented, here is the instructions:

Use the Project file to produce the datasets. You can edit the parameters that go into the Grey-Scott model near the top of the file. There is also directories you can enter.

This will produce a lot of data, but the most important is the parameter_pattern_log.csv which the ML trains on.

Afterwards, use the ML file to run the machine learning algorithm on the produced dataset file. Near the top you can alter the number of epochs. It will produce a graph of predictions.

Enjoy!
